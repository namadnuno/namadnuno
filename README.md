# About me

Since I a young I had a deep interest in technology, I tried to build I robot a couple of times, but it didn't work out that well.
After my college years when I gained an abroad knowledge about the web and programming I decided to start investing more in this area. Through one of my old teacher, I started to do some freelancing jobs for local businesses from landing pages to complex web apps. 
After a while, I decided to enrol in my Bachelor's degree where I fell in love with the bits and bites of technology, from writing software that works to managing and maintaining a project. 
Over the past couple of years (6+), I had the opportunity to help businesses by contributing to the industry's best practices and with code the works.
